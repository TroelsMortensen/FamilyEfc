# Overview

The purpose of this repository is to practice LINQ.

I have set up:
* A handful of entity classes (see entity class diagram below)
* A DbContext with relevant DbSets
* A helper class to pretty print
* A unit test class with exercises

You clone the repository.

Then you update the Data Source path to the .db file in the FamilyContext. It is currently set to my local path. It must be updated to point to your local db file.
